# Spoken-Language-Classification
With advancement in technology and increase in the amount of audio content, we need proper mechanisms to analyze and study sound and speech. Sound analysis has been performed for genre identification, but not much research has been done for language detection. The speech to text applications need prior information of the language for conversion. Efficient language identification systems can hence assist several such applications.

Our aim is to build classifiers and networks to predict language for a given speech audio file.

Components of the project include:
Binary language classification - English, Hindi
Multiclass classification - Hindi, Kannada, Dutch, Arabic, South Korean, Thai
Audio segmentation - Detect English and Hindi segments in the code mixed audio file

The code for Binary Language Classification and Audio segmentation is in "Spoken_Language_Binary_Classification.ipynb"
The code for Multi Language Classification is in "Spoken_Language_Multi_Classification.ipynb"
